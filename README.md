## How to Run

This project requires a Java JDK and the JavaFX SDK.

1. Download the JavaFX SDK: Make sure you have the JavaFX SDK downloaded and know its location (let's call it PATH_TO_JAVAFX_SDK). You can get it from GluonHQ.

2. Compile the code:

```javac --module-path $PATH_TO_JAVAFX_SDK/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml SimpleOSGui.java```



(On Windows, you might need to use %PATH_TO_JAVAFX_SDK% and semicolons)

3. Run the application:

```java --module-path $PATH_TO_JAVAFX_SDK/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml SimpleOSGui```
